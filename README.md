# Premier League Magic 8-ball 

## A Codeacademy project within the Full Stack Engineer Career Path

**This README will be updated as the project develops**

The goal of this project is to produce a Node.js file that will randomly select various data and output them to the terminal to produce a random result. 

This app will create a random string output to the terminal upon every run, various examples: 

- *“Chelsea will finish in nth position, lol”*

or

- *"Brentford are in nth postion, best not to think about it."*
