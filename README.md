# Premier League Magic 8-ball 

## A Codeacademy project


The goal of this project is to produce a Node.js file that will randomly select various data and return to the terminal to produce a random result. 

The variables chosen were Premier League Clubs, their position within the league and an A.I generated list of phrases a person may say to another upon viewing the position of a club.

This app creates and returns random string output to the terminal upon every run, various examples could include: 

- *“Aston Villa is in 20th, what a shocker!”*

or

- *"Fulham are in 1st, unbeeeelievable Jeff!"*
